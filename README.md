## kadnode(1) - P2P name resolver daemon

## SYNOPSIS

`kadnode`  [--announce domain] [--daemon] [...]

`kadnode-ctl`  [...]

## DESCRIPTION

**KadNode** is a small P2P DNS resolver based on a Distributed Hash Table (DHT).
KadNode can intercept and resolve DNS request in the systems background.
Every instance can also announce any domain like e.g. myname.p2p. People on others
devices running KadNode can then enter myname.p2p into their browsers or other programs in order
to reach the announcing host. To avoid name clashes, cryptographic public/private key pairs can be used.
This makes it possible to have a personal and decentralized DynDNS service.
The [DHT](https://github.com/jech/dht) is identical to the one used in the Transmission Bittorrent client and works'on the Internet as well as on local networks.

Features:

* IPv4/IPv6 support
* TLS support (e.g. can use browser CA chain)
* Plain public key links as <public-hex-key>.p2p
* UPnP/NAT-PMP support
* local peer discovery
* small size, ~85KB depending on features
* public/secret key authentication
* command line interface (kadnode-ctl)
* NSS support through /etc/nsswitch.conf
* integrated simplified DNS server and proxy (handles A, AAAA, and SRV requests)
* packages for ArchLinux/Debian/FreeBSD/MacOSX/LEDE/Windows
* peer file import/export on startup/shutdown and every 24h

Crypto/TLS support is provided by [libmbedtls](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/). The library is also used by OpenWrt.

## JOIN THE SWARM

KadNode needs to know at least one active peer to join / bootstrap into the swarm.
There are three ways to archieve this:

1. Provide one or more peers to the command line arguments. These could be public BitTorrent trackers, or other KadNode instances:
```
kadnode --peer bttracker.debian.org --peer 192.168.1.1
```

2. Ping a node using the KadNode console if present:
```
kadnode-ctl ping bttracker.debian.org
```

3. Use the local peer discovery feature. Just start KadNode and it will try to discover other KadNode nodes in the local network.


Also provide a --peerfile argument to let KadNode backup its peerlist on shutdown and every 24h.
This ensures successful bootstrapping on next startup.


## AUTHENTICATION

KadNode provides two authentication schemes. One works via x509 certificates and TLS. The other one uses raw secret/public keys and is hence called bob.

### Via TLS

Typically there are two KadNode instances involved.

One node announces a domain, e.g. mynode.p2p. The other node looks for the IP address of the announcing node. Authentication happens via TLS, which in turn uses X509 certificates. This is the same as HTTPS, but without a HTTP session.

```
kadnode --tls-server-cert mynode.crt,mynode.key
```

KadNode will announce the common name field inside the certificate. No --announce is needed in this case.

As an alternative, ownerhip can be proven using a HTTPS server running on the same host.
In this case, KadNode only needs to announce the domain:

```
kadnode --announce mynode.p2p:443
```

The other node doing the lookup for mynode.p2p needs to have access to the root certificate that has been used to sign mynode.crt. These can be a common web browsers certificates:

```
kadnode --tls-client-cert /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla
```

Own certificates authorities can be created and used, of course.

### Via BOB

First create an elliptic curve secret key file:

```
kadnode --bob-create-key mysecretkey.pem
Generating secp256r1 key pair...
Public key: c492192ac20144ed2a43d57e7239f5ef5f6bb418a51600980e55ff565cc916a4
Wrote secret key to mysecretkey.pem
```

Now make the secret key load on KadNode startup:
```
kadnode --bob-load-key mysecretkey.pem
```

Any reachable node can now resolve c492192ac20144ed2a43d57e7239f5ef5f6bb418a51600980e55ff565cc916a4.p2p to the IP address of the announcing host. There is no need to share any more information beforehand.

## No Authentication

KadNode also allows to just lookup a hexdecimal string and to get IP addresses as return.
This is the plain use of the DHT. The hexadecimal string will be cut down or filled up with zeros internally to fit the size the DHT uses (currently 20 bytes).

## OPTIONS

  * `--announce` *name:port*  
    Announce a name and port. The port may be used for the authentication provider, e.g. 443 for a webserver using HTTPS or the DHT port for Kadnode.  
    This option may occur multiple times.

### KadNode Console Commands

When not started in background, KadNode accepts a variety of commands from standard input.

  * `status`  
    Print the node id, the number of known nodes / searches / stored hashes and more.

  * `lookup` *query*  
    Lookup the IP addresses of all nodes that claim to satisfy the query.  
    The first call will start the search.

  * `announce` [*query*[<i>:*port*</i>] [<i>*minutes*</i>]]  
    Announce that this instance is associated with a query  
    and an optional port. The default port is random (but not equal 0).  
    No *minutes* trigger a single announcement. Negative *minutes*  
    last for the entire runtime. Otherwise the lifetime is set *minutes* into the future.  
    No arguments will announce all identifiers at once.

  * `import` *addr*  
    Send a ping to another KadNode instance to establish a connection.

  * `export`  
    Print a few good nodes.

  * `list` [`blacklist`|`buckets`|`constants`|`forwardings`|`results`|`searches`|`storage`|`values`]  
    List various internal data structures.

  * `blacklist` *addr*  
    Blacklist a specifc IP address.

## KadNode External Console

KadNode allows a limited set of commands to be send from any user from other consoles.

`kadnode-ctl` [-p port] [status|lookup|announce|import|export|blacklist]

  * `-p` *port*  
    The port used to connect to the command shell of a local KadNode instance (Default: 1700).

  * `-h`  
    Print this help.

## Features List

Most features are optional and can be left out to reduce the binary size:

* cmd - Command line. Mostly useful for debugging.
* debug - Enabled debug output. For debugging.
* lpd - Local peer discovery. Finds local peers.
* tls - TLS authentication. Uses libmbedtls.
* bob - Raw secret/public key authentication. Uses libmbedtls.
* dns - DNS interface support.
* nss - Name Service Switch interface support.
* upnp - Universal Plug and Play support. For automatic port forwarding.
* natpmp - NAT Port Mapping support. For automatic port forwarding.

Call `kadnode --version` to get the list of included features.

## Automatic Port Forwarding

If KadNode runs on a computer in a private network, it will try to establish a port forwarding for the DHT port and ports used for announcements.
Port forwarding only works if UPnP/NAT-PMP is compiled into KadNode and is supported by the gateway/router.
This is useful to make a local service (e.g. a web server) reachable from the Internet without the need to
configure port forwardings manually.
